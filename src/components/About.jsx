      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <p>
        I'm currently a CSE Junior at GEC Raipur and have a passion for Web
        Development. I code and create web elements for amazing people around
        the world. I like to work with new people as new people are new
        experiences. Besides Web, I also like to play with Machine Learning, and
        with algorithm problems on LeetCode.
